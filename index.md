# Floor Cleaning Robot
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was setting up the car Chasis, screwing in the motor to the frame. Then setting upp the echo sensor on the bread board and giving it input, output functions so it could do its job of using echolocation to find if there is an object in front of the sensor. Then I wired the arduino to and from the Echo sensor on the breadboard and wrote the code involving echolocation. The main issue I had with the echo sensor was the code because I did not know the distance formula but setting up the echo sensor to read distance from an object was rather straight forward.

# Second Milestone
My second mileston involved using the arduino shield to allow the motor to run forwards and backwards and giving the motors restrictions. Since I had only 2 motors and 2 wheels instead of 4, it was simpler to setup than if it was a 4 wheeled car. 

My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Starter Project
My starter project was Simon Says. The heatsinks, the sd card, and the controller were all added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working. Instead of the Raspberry Pi Os software, I had to first download a different software called Retro Pie. With Retro Pie, I needed to download an Imager for Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi Imager automatically downloads a list of the latest versions of Raspbian supported by the Raspberry Pi. Raspbian is the typical Raspberry Pi Os software, the one I needed on the Raspberry Pi was Retro Pi. With the included SD card, I plugged in the SD into my computer and launched the Imager. The imager allowed me to set the Operating System to Retro Pi instead of Raspbian onto the SD card. With the OS imaged onto the SD, I plugged the SD card back into the Raspberry Pi and rebooted the system and Retro Bi booted up.
